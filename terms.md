> *Overview:**  
> These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of DarkPurpleOF's Website (the "Platform"). Read them carefully. By registering, accessing, or using the Platform you agree to these Terms in full. If you do not accept these Terms, your account will be deleted and you must not use the Platform.

## Liability & Responsibility
DarkPurpleOF's Website is **not liable** for:
- Any negligence resulting from failing to read these Terms.
- Any disciplinary action, restriction, suspension, account deletion, or permanent ban that results from violations of these Terms.

Refusing or failing to read these Terms does **not** exempt you from them. Not accepting the Terms will result in **immediate account deletion**.

## Account Standing & Ban System (Overview)
Account standing indicates the trust/restriction level applied to an account. Standings include (but are not limited to):

- **Good Standing** — no known violations.
- **Under Review** — flagged; limited functionality while we investigate.
- **Suspended** — temporary loss of access for a defined period.
- **Permanent Ban** — account removed and access revoked forever.
- **Notified to Law Enforcement** — evidence forwarded when legally appropriate.

All bans include associated content **removal** (deleted/hidden/taken-down items), and in many cases apply across all linked accounts. Repeated or severe violations may result in immediate escalation (e.g., Permanent Ban or law enforcement notification).
